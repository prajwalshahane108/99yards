              At 99 Yards Academy, our mission is to empower fashion entrepreneurs by providing the tools, knowledge, and 
              resources needed to thrive in the industry. The idea for the Academy was born in 2022 when Yevgeniya and Tony 
              Henry, founder of the 99 Yards app and now an advisor for the Academy, joined forces to create a solution that 
              goes beyond educationâ€”offering actionable strategies and resources. In late 2023, Manish, a seasoned technical 
              expert with over 20 years of experience, became our technical co-founder, leading all aspects of product 
              development with a focus on quality and scalability.
